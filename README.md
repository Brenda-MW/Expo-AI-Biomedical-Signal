# Expo-AI-Biomedical-Signal
Wearable and implantable medical applications rely heavily on efficient algorithms that can process real-time data on resource constrained devices. Biomedical signals such as ECG, EEG and EMG   are often noisy, nonlinear, and exhibit variability across individuals and conditions. It is challenging to develop robust AI models that can reliably interpret these signals. Wearable devices also impose strict constraints on the computational efficiency and latency of these AI algorithms. Deploying AI models on low-power and memory-constrained devices requires significant optimization to ensure that the algorithms can operate within the limited computational and energy budgets.

This workshop addresses these challenges by providing participants with hands-on experience optimizing a signal source separation algorithm using convolution neural network for deployment on resource-limited hardware. The primary objectives are to equip attendees with the skills to reduce computational complexity and perform structural and data-type compression without compromising the performance of AI models. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a comprehensive understanding of the techniques and tools necessary to implement and optimize AI-driven biomedical signal processing for deployment in healthcare, fitness, and biomedical research.

Hardware and Software Requirements
